Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses in a network. To analyze ARP over a device connected to the internet using Packet Tracer, follow these steps:

Set Up the Network:
Create a network topology with at least one device (e.g., a PC) connected to a router and internet cloud.
Assign an IP address to the device and ensure the router is configured for internet access.

Generate ARP Traffic:
Ping a website or an external server from the device to trigger ARP requests.
Capture and Inspect ARP Requests:
Switch to Simulation Mode in Packet Tracer.
Filter for ARP packets to capture requests sent by the device to resolve the MAC address of the gateway.

Analyze ARP Responses:
Examine the ARP reply from the router, providing the MAC address of the gateway.
Observe how the device updates its ARP table.

Document Observations:
Note the IP and MAC address pairings in the ARP table.
Identify potential issues like duplicate ARP responses or missing entries.
Use Case Scenarios
Local Network Communication: Analyze ARP interactions within the LAN before packets are sent to the internet.
Troubleshooting Connectivity Issues: Identify ARP-related problems, such as incorrect MAC mappings or stale entries.
Learning Protocol Behavior: Understand how ARP operates as part of the internet communication process.
